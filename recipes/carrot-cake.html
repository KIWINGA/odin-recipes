    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe provides the most versatile and delicious cake one can make from scratch</p>
        <p>Growing up, if someone mentioned a fruit cake I would imagine strawberry cakes or a vanilla cake filled with raisins. But a vegetable cake - I would be livid! But I grew to learn to love this cake thanks to the texture and moistness the carrots bring to the cake</p>
        <p>It does not need super fancy baking equipment and some of the ingredients can be sourced from your own backyard farm!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li><sub>1</sub>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup raisins</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> canola or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup lightly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups grated peeled carrots (use 4-5 large carrots)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom with parchment paper and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
            <li>Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>ECool cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks. Remove the parchment paper and cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing.</li>
        </ol>
