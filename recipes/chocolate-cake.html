    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (176째C). Lightly grease three 9-inch cake rounds or dust with flour or cocoa powder. Alternatively, you can lightly grease the pans and line them with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a low speed until smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything is mixed in.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly among the three prepared pans, about 3 cups per pan. Tap the cake pans gently on the counter to allow any bubbles to rise to the top and escape.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350째F (176째C) oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool the cakes on wire racks for 15 minutes, then remove them from the pans and place them on the wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
